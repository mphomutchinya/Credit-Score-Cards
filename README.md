## üìò Overview
This project applies **unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering)** to segment credit applicants into meaningful financial profiles based on behavioral and financial ratios.  
The model identifies distinct groups such as **Low Risk**, **Medium Risk**, and **High Risk**, which can be used for **credit risk assessment**, **customer profiling**, and **loan decision support**.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Cluster customers by their **financial ratios** and **credit characteristics**.  
- Label clusters into interpretable **risk categories**.  
- Provide insights that support **credit policy** and **risk management**.

## üß† Methodology

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preparation
Input features used for clustering:
- `debt_to_income_ratio`
- `credit_score`
- `savings_to_income_ratio`

Data was scaled and cleaned prior to clustering using `StandardScaler`.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ K-Means Clustering
- **Algorithm:** K-Means  
- **k (clusters):** determined using *Elbow Method* and *Silhouette Score*.  
- Each customer receives a `cluster` label representing their risk group.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Categorization
Clusters were mapped to qualitative risk categories via a custom dictionary (`risk_mapping`):

| Cluster | Risk Category |
|----------|----------------|
| 0 | Low Risk |
| 1 | Medium Risk |
| 2 | High Risk |

This mapping was applied across:
- `dev_profiles`
- `val_profiles`
- `hold_profiles`

Each record includes:
- `cluster` ‚Äì numerical label from K-Means  
- `risk_category` ‚Äì qualitative risk level  
- `risk_score` ‚Äì standardized numeric indicator

### üßæ Sample Output
```text
| debt_to_income_ratio | credit_score | savings_to_income_ratio | cluster | risk_category | risk_score |
|----------------------:|--------------:|-------------------------:|---------:|---------------|------------:|
| 1.00 | 693 | 5.23 | 1 | Medium Risk | -1.326 |
| 0.00 | 424 | 0.81 | 0 | Low Risk | -0.579 |
| 20.42 | 769 | 7.97 | 2 | High Risk | -1.452 |


Silhouette Score ‚Äì to measure separation between clusters

Risk profiles were visually inspected through 2D/3D scatter plots.
